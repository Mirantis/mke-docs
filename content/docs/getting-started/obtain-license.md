## Download your MKE license

1. Open an email from Mirantis Support with the subject Welcome to Mirantisâ€™
   CloudCare Portal and follow the instructions for logging in.

2. If you did not receive the CloudCare Portal email, it is likely that you
   have not yet been added as a Designated Contact. To remedy this, contact
   your Designated Administrator.

3. In the top navigation bar, click **Environments**.

4. Click the **Cloud Name** associated with the license you want to download.

5. Scroll down to **License Information** and click the **License File URL**. 
   A new tab opens in your browser.

6. Click **View file** to download your license file.

Though MKE is generally a subscription-only service, Mirantis offers a free
trial license by request. Use our [contact form](https://www.mirantis.com/contact)
to request a free trial license.

4. Click **Save settings**. MKE will automatically update with the new settings.

## Set the license in the configuration

1. Set the license token under ``spec.license.token`` in the MKE 4
   configuration file:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      license:
        token: <your-license-token>
    ```

2. Apply the license:

   ```commandline
   mkectl apply
   ```

3. Check the license status, users can see the status of the ``mkeconfig``
   resource:

   ```commandline
   kubectl -n mke get mkeconfig mke -ojsonpath="{.status.licenseStatus}" | jq 
   ```

   Example output:
   
   ```json
   {
     "expiration": "2027-10-10T07:00:00Z",
     "licenseType": "Offline",
     "maxEngines": 10,
     "scanningEnabled": true,
     "subject": "sf|0014W0000341gYFQAY|a2X4W000000ZeatUAC",
     "tier": "Production"
   }
   ```
