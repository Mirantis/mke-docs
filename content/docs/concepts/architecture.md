Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) 4k is an enterprise-grade, production-ready
Kubernetes platform that is designed to be secure, scalable, and reliable.

You can manage the entire MKE 4k cluster through the mke4.yaml configuration
file. Refer to [Configuration](../configuration) for details.

## Components

An MKE 4k cluster is comprised of the following components:

- k0s Kubernetes distribution
- Calico CNI
- MKE 4k Control Plane
- System and user services


### k0s
k0s is a lightweight and open-source Kubernetes distribution that acts as the foundational runtime for MKE 4k clusters. For more information, refer to the [k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable//).

#### Networking

MKE 4k provides secure, scalable, policy-driven networking through the Calico container network interface (CNI).

The Calico configuration at installation is as follows:
- IPv4 only, with a fixed Pod CIDR of `192.168.0.0/16`
- Datastore mode set to `kdd`
- `kube-proxy` mode set to `iptables`
- A `vxlan` backend that uses the default port of `4789` for traffic and the default virtual network ID of `4096`

Refer to [Container Network Interface](../cni) for the network configuration details

### MKE4k Control Plane: `mke-operator` + `k0rdent`

The MKE4k Control Plane is responsible for orchestrating, managing, and maintaining the lifecycle of MKE4k cluster and services:

* `mke-operator`: A Kubernetes-native operator that automates installation, upgrades, configuration of system and user services 
* `k0rdent`: An open-source component that manages lifecycle for the services configured by `mke-operator`


## System and User Services

These are Kubernetes workloads that run within the clusterâ€”ranging from system-level services (monitoring, logging, ingress) to user-defined applications. 
Their deployment and lifecycle are managed by the MKE4k control plane (`mke-operator` and `k0rdent`).
