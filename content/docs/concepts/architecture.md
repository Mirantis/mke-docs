Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) 4k is an enterprise-grade, production-ready
Kubernetes platform that is designed to be secure, scalable, and reliable.

You can manage the entire MKE 4k cluster through the mke4.yaml configuration
file. Refer to [Configuration](../configuration) for details.

## Components

MKE4k cluster is composed of following components:

### k0s (Kubernetes)
A lightweight and open-source Kubernetes distribution that acts as the foundational runtime for MKE4k clusters.
To learn more, refer to [k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable//).

#### Networking

By default, MKE4k includes Calico CNI, deployed and managed using the Tigera Operator, to provide secure, scalable, and policy-driven networking.

Calico is installed as the Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin, with the following configuration:
- IPv4 only, with a fixed Pod CIDR of `192.168.0.0/16`.
- The datastore mode set to `kdd`.
- `kube-proxy` set to `iptables` mode.
- A `vxlan` backend, which uses the default port of `4789` for traffic and default virtual network ID of `4096`.

Refer to [Container Network Interface](../cni) for the network configuration details

### MKE4k Control Plane: `mke-operator` + `k0rdent`

The MKE4k Control Plane is responsible for orchestrating, managing, and maintaining the lifecycle of MKE4k cluster and services:

* `mke-operator`: A Kubernetes-native operator that automates installation, upgrades, configuration of system and user services 
* `k0rdent`: An open-source component that manages lifecycle for the services configured by `mke-operator`


## System and User Services

These are Kubernetes workloads that run within the clusterâ€”ranging from system-level services (monitoring, logging, ingress) to user-defined applications. 
Their deployment and lifecycle are managed by the MKE4k control plane (`mke-operator` and `k0rdent`).
