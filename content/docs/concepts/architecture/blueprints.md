## MKE4 blueprints
Blueprints are the bread and butter of MKE4. They let the user define details about their cluster such as how many nodes there are in the cluster, how to access the nodes, and any specific MKE4 feature that you want to enable/disable.


### Creating your Blueprint
A default MKE blueprint can be generated by running `mkectl init > mke.yaml`. This will generate a default blueprint that you can modify to deploy MKE on your cluster.

To apply your blueprint to a set of pre-existing machines, modify the `hosts` section of the blueprint.

An example of a hosts section is shown below:

```yaml
hosts:
- ssh:
    address: 18.224.23.158
    keyPath: "/absolute/path/to/private/key.pem"
    port: 22
    user: root
  role: controller+worker
- ssh:
    address: 18.224.23.158
    keyPath: "/absolute/path/to/private/key.pem"
    port: 22
    user: ubuntu
  role: worker
- ssh:
    address: 18.117.87.45
    keyPath: "/absolute/path/to/private/key.pem"
    port: 22
    user: ubuntu
  role: worker
```


### Choosing Addons
A core part of MKE4 is the ability to selectively install addons from from a set of curated and tested addons. `mkectl init` will enable a set of default addons that are considered core to MKE4. You can modify the generated blueprint to enable/disable additional addons as you wish, as well as modify settings on each particular addon.
