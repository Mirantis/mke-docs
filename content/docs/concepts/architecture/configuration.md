## MKE4 Configuration & Blueprints
The MKE4 Configuration file lets the user define details about their cluster such as how many nodes there are in the cluster, how to access the nodes, and any specific MKE4 feature that you want to enable/disable.


### Creating your Config
A default MKE config can be generated by running `mkectl init > mke.yaml`. This will generate a default config that you can modify to deploy MKE on your cluster.

To apply your config to a set of pre-existing machines, modify the `hosts` section of the config.

An example of a hosts section is shown below:

```yaml
hosts:
- ssh:
    address: 18.224.23.158
    keyPath: "/absolute/path/to/private/key.pem"
    port: 22
    user: root
  role: controller+worker
- ssh:
    address: 18.224.23.158
    keyPath: "/absolute/path/to/private/key.pem"
    port: 22
    user: ubuntu
  role: worker
- ssh:
    address: 18.117.87.45
    keyPath: "/absolute/path/to/private/key.pem"
    port: 22
    user: ubuntu
  role: worker
```


### Choosing Addons
A core part of MKE4 is the ability to selectively install addons from from a set of curated and tested addons. `mkectl init` will enable a set of default addons that are considered core to MKE4. You can modify the generated config to enable/disable additional addons as you wish, as well as modify settings on each particular addon.

### Blueprints
MKE4 uses the blueprint operator under the hood. All MKE4 configs are translated into blueprints. A blueprint is a special type of file that is used to create a Kubernetes Custom Resource (CRD) also called a Blueprint. Thus the blueprint file must be valid Kubernetes YAML and contains many of the same fields as standard Kubernetes Objects.

A blueprint is roughly composed of 3 sections.
1. The section detailing the Kubernetes Provider and any specific settings for that provider. This section is mostly managed by `mkectl` independently of the user provided MKE config.
2. The section detailing the infrastructure that will be used for the Kubernetes Cluster. This is essentially just the `hosts` section of the MKE config.
3. The components section. This section is composed of the various addons specified in the MKE config. `mkectl` takes the user-friendly MKE config options and translates them into specific settings in either Helm or Manifest type addons that are deployed into the cluster.
