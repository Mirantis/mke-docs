| Feature                                                                 | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Authentication](../../../configuration/authentication)                       | MKE uses Dex for authentication. Dex serves as a proxy between your MKE cluster and your authentication providers, supporting the following authentication protocols:<br> <br> * OpenID Connect (OIDC)<br> * Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)<br> * Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) |
| [Authorization](../../../migrate-from-mke-3/#rbac-migrations)                 | As MKE 4 does not support Swarm mode, the platform uses standard [Kubernetes RBAC authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).                                                                                                                                          |
| [Backup&nbsp;and&nbsp;restore](../../../configuration/backup-restore)                   | MKE 4 supports backup and restoration of cluster data through the use of the [Velero](https://velero.io/) add-on. System backup is enabled by default.                                                                                                                                                    |
| [CLI](../getting-started/install-MKE-CLI)                               | The MKE CLI tool, mkectl, can be installed automtically using an `install.sh` script, or it can be done manually.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [Cloud Providers](../../../configuration/cloudproviders)                      | AWS is currently the only managed cloud service provider add-on that MKE 4 directly supports. Different cloud service providers can be put to use, however this requires manual configuation.                                                                                                             |
| [CoreDNS&nbsp;Lameduck](../../../configuration/coredns-lameduck)                   | The MKE configuration file includes options to enable and disable lameduck in CoreDNS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [cAdvisor](../../../configuration/monitoring/#cadvisor)                       | cAdvisor is an open-source tool that collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information in reference to running containers. Though disabled in MKE4 by default, it can be enabled through the MKE configuration file.                                                                               |

| [Ingress](../../../configuration/ingress)                                     | Traffic that originates outside of your cluster, ingress traffic, is managed through the use of an ingress controller. By default, MKE 4 offers NGINX Ingress Controller.                                                                                                                                 |

| [Logging, Monitoring and Alerting](../../../configuration/monitoring)         | The MKE4 monitoring setup is based on the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack), offering a comprehensive solution for collecting, storing, and visualizing metrics.                                                        |
| [Container Network Interface (CNI)](../../../concepts/cni)                                     | MKE4 supports the Calico MVP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Node Feature Discovery (NFD)](../../../configuration/node-feature-discovery) | Node Feature Discovery (NFD) software detects the hardware features that are available on each node in a Kubernetes cluster, and advertises the detected features through node labels.                                                                                                                    |
