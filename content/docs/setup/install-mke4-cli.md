# Install MKE 4 CLI

You can download `mkectl`, the MKE CLI tool, from the MKE 4 repository
[Releases](https://github.com/MirantisContainers/mke/releases) page. Envisioned
as a single binary, capable of managing MKE 4 clusters without any
additional dependencies, as of commit `e19af33` the MKE CLI still requires that
you have the following tools installed on your system:

- `kubectl`, version `1.29.0` or later ([download](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl))
- `k0sctl`, version `0.17.0` or later ([download](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0sctl/releases))
