By default, an admin user is created whenevr you create a fresh cluster, with the username `admin` and a randomly-generated password. This password is printed out after successfully creating the cluster.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The password is printed following the successful creation of the cluster.
It is not stored anywhere on the cluster, and it is not possible to retrieve it
later. Thus, if the password is not saved in the install output logs, you must recreate the cluster to gain access.
