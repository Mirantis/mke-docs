{{< callout type="important" >}}The MKE configuration file documentation is up-to-date for the latest MKE
release. As such, if you are running an earlier version of MKE, you may
encounter detail for configuration options and parameters that are not
applicable to the version of MKE you are currently running.

Refer to the MKE Release Notes for specific version-by-version information on
MKE configuration file additions and changes.
{{< /callout >}}

The configuring of an MKE cluster
takes place through the application of a TOML file. You use this file, the MKE
configuration file, to import and export MKE configurations, to both create new
MKE instances and to modify existing ones.

Refer to example-config in the MKE CLI reference documentation to learn how to
download an example MKE configuration file.
