You can set MKE to automatically record and transmit data to Mirantis through
an encrypted channel for monitoring and analysis purposes. This data helps the
Mirantis Customer Success Organization to better understand how customers
use MKE. It also provides product usage statistics, which is key feedback that
helps product teams in their efforts to enhance Mirantis products and
services.

## Enable telemetry through the MKE CLI

1. Access the MKE configuration file.
2. Set the `telemetry.enabled` field to `true`.

   ```yaml
   spec:
     tracking:
       enabled: true
   ```

4. Run the  `mkectl apply` command to apply the new settings.

After a few moments, the change will reconcile in the configuration. From this point onward,
MKE will transmit key usage data to Mirantis by way of a secure Segment endpoint.

2. Click **Admin Settings** to display the available options.
