# The Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) documentation

This repository contains the assets required to build the MKE website and documentation.

In preparation for our 4.0 GA release, we'll be transitioning to a static website generated by tools like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). In the meantime, you can find pre-release information at this [release page](content/releases/README.md).
